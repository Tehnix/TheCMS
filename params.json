{"name":"TheCMS","body":"##Information / README / Documentation / Installation\r\n####0x01        Intro\r\nTheCMS is a PHP based CMS. Mainly as a learn-by-doing project, but is quite   potent for actual use. By looking at projects like Drupal and Django, simply taking some of the features we like and trying to avoid those we don't we have\r\ncreated a somewhat full CMS solution that is also easily expandable.\r\n\r\n####0x02        License\r\nIs found in the license file.

First clone the repos\r\n\r\n    <code>$ git clone git@github.com:ZealDev/TheCMS.git</code>\r\n\r\n2. Visit the index.php page once, and a settings.php file should be created.\r\n    You will need to fill this out with your settings.\r\n3. Your good to go!\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n##Files and folders\r\n\r\n####1x01        manage.php\r\nIn this document resides the main driveforece of TheCMS. The database class,  \r\nmodule class, templates class and the various class's that handles the login  \r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n####1x02        settings.php\r\nHere is all the constants that needs defining throughout TheCMS. From database\r\nconnection to URLs and default mailer behavior.\r\n\r\n####1x03        urls.php\r\nHere is the default url handling (derived from .htaccess's urlrewrite, that   \r\nputs everything behind a ?handle= query). The path to admin panel, and main   \r\napplication is defined here.\r\n\r\n####1x04        INSTALL.sql\r\nOur sql information for the basic setup of TheCMS\r\n\r\n####1x05        modules/\r\nAll modules go in here, organized in folders. The structure goes:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    modules/mymodule/model.php # Holds the core of the module\r\n\r\n    modules/mymodule/urls.php # Handles all the urls and passes to view.php\r\n\r\n    modules/mymodule/view.php # What to display to the user\r\n\r\n    modules/mymodule/admin.php # What to display in admin\r\n\r\n    modules/mymodule/INSTALL.sql # All SQL information\r\n\r\n    modules/mymodule/DELETE.sql # Deletion information for SQL\r\n\r\n    modules/mymodule/style.css # CSS to be included with the module\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of these files are required, but their names must match their use, else  \r\nit will result in wrong order of includes and can essentially cause some nice \r\n500's ;)...\r\n\r\n####1x06        templates/\r\nIn here we create our 'themes'. These can override existing page in the \r\ndefault folder.\r\n\r\n####1x07        resources/\r\nAll of our resource files. This includes images, css, javascript but also     \r\nerror documents and uploads.\r\n\r\n####1x08        cgi-bin/\r\nOur backup scripts written in python\r\n\r\n####1x09        _backup/\r\nLocation for all our backups. Server backups are located in the main folder  \r\nsaved as .zip files ,and database backups are located in: _backup/database/   \r\nwith .sql extension.","tagline":"A PHP based CMS","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
