<h4>0x01        Intro</h4>

<p>TheCMS is a PHP based CMS. Mainly as a learn-by-doing project, but is quite   potent for actual use. By looking at projects like Drupal and Django, simply taking some of the features we like and trying to avoid those we don't we have
created a somewhat full CMS solution that is also easily expandable.</p>

<li><p>Your good to go!</p></li>
</ol><hr><h2>Files and folders</h2>

<h4>1x01        manage.php</h4>

<p>In this document resides the main driveforece of TheCMS. The database class,<br>
module class, templates class and the various class's that handles the login<br>
system.</p>

<h4>1x02        settings.php</h4>

<p>Here is all the constants that needs defining throughout TheCMS. From database
connection to URLs and default mailer behavior.</p>

<h4>1x03        urls.php</h4>

<p>Here is the default url handling (derived from .htaccess's urlrewrite, that<br>
puts everything behind a ?handle= query). The path to admin panel, and main<br>
application is defined here.</p>

<h4>1x04        INSTALL.sql</h4>

<p>Our sql information for the basic setup of TheCMS</p>

<h4>1x05        modules/</h4>

<p>All modules go in here, organized in folders. The structure goes:</p>

<pre>
    modules/mymodule/model.php # Holds the core of the module

    modules/mymodule/urls.php # Handles all the urls and passes to view.php

    modules/mymodule/view.php # What to display to the user

    modules/mymodule/admin.php # What to display in admin

    modules/mymodule/INSTALL.sql # All SQL information

    modules/mymodule/DELETE.sql # Deletion information for SQL

    modules/mymodule/style.css # CSS to be included with the module
</pre>

<p>None of these files are required, but their names must match their use, else<br>
it will result in wrong order of includes and can essentially cause some nice 
500's ;)...</p>

<h4>1x06        templates/</h4>

<p>In here we create our 'themes'. These can override existing page in the 
default folder.</p>

<h4>1x07        resources/</h4>

<p>All of our resource files. This includes images, css, javascript but also<br>
error documents and uploads.</p>

<h4>1x08        cgi-bin/</h4>

<p>Our backup scripts written in python</p>

<h4>1x09        _backup/</h4>

<p>Location for all our backups. Server backups are located in the main folder<br>
saved as .zip files ,and database backups are located in: _backup/database/<br>
with .sql extension.</p>
