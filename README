0x01        README / Documentation
TheCMS is a PHP based CMS. Mainly as a learn-by-doing project, but is quite   
potent for actual use. By looking at projects like Drupal and Django, simple  
taking some of the features we like and trying to avoid those we don't we have
created a somewhat full CMS solution that is also easily expandable.

1x01        manage.php
In this document resides the main driveforece of TheCMS. The database class,  
module class, templates class and the various class's that handles the login  
system.

1x02        settings.php
Here is all the constants that needs defining throughout TheCMS. From database
connection to URLs and default mailer behavior.

1x03        urls.php
Here is the default url handling (derived from .htaccess's urlrewrite, that   
puts everything behind a ?handle= query). The path to admin panel, and main   
application is defined here.

2x10        Using the class's
    The Database class:
/*
---- Instantiate class -----
$Database = new Database;
---- Get one entry -----
$fetchone = $Database->fetchOne($table, array($needle_field->$value));
$fetchone['field'];
---- Get many entries -----
$fetchAll = $Database->fetchAll($table, array($needle_field->$value));
foreach($fetchAll as $data)
{
    $data['field'];
}
---- Insert an entry -----
$Database->insert($table, array($field1->$value1, $field2=>$value2))
---- Update an entry -----
$Database->update($table, array($field1->$value1, $field2=>$value2),
                                array($needle_field->$value))
---- Delete an entry -----
$Database->delete($table, array($needle_field->$value));
---- Count ----
$Database->count($table, array($needle_field->$value));
*/

    The Modules class:
/*
----- Instantiate class -----
$modules = new Modules;
----- Get all modules -----
$modules = new Modules;
$getModules = $modules->getModules();
foreach($getModules as $module)
{
    include('modules/'.$module.'/'.$module.'.class.php');
}
---- Run install on modules ----
$modules->installSQL();
*/

    The Templates class:

/*
---- Example 1 -----
$template_dir = TEMPLATES_ROOT . end(explode(DS, dirname(__file__))) . DS;
$content = new Template($template_dir . 'page.tpl');
$content->set('id', $getpage['id']);
$content->set('Title', $getpage['name']);
$content->set('Content' , $getpage['content']);
$content = $content->output();

<h1>{% TITLE %} {% ID %}</h1>
<p>{% CONTENT %}</p>
---- Example 2 ----
# Using $content from above !
$layout = new Template(TEMPLATES_ROOT . 'main.tpl');
$layout->set('ID', '2');
$layout->set('TITLE', 'T3$t1ng l13k t3h 60$$ ! !');
$layout->set('CONTENT', $content);
print $layout->output();
